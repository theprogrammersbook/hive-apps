Indexes are maintained in a separate table.


When to use an index
===========================
-	very large files
-	require more performance than you are getting
-	access pattern is predictable
-	building a data model (making access pattern even more predictable)

When you don't need them
===========================
-	using orc file format
-	when using tez execution engine

Compact 
	Compact indexing stores the pair of indexed columnâ€™s value and its blockid.
	
	Example
	create index airport_state_index on table airport_raw(state) as 'compact' with deferred rebuild;
	alter index airport_state_index on airport_raw rebuild;
	desc ok_airline__airport_raw_airport_state_index__;
	drop index airport_state_index ON airport_raw;

Bitmap
	-	Bitmap indexing stores the combination of indexed column value and list of rows as a bitmap.
	-	Used for columns with distinct values

	Example 1
	select dest, count(1) from flight_raw where year = 2007 and origin='DL' group by dest;

	create index flight_origin_dest_idx on table flight_raw(origin, dest) as 'bitmap' with deferred rebuild;
	alter index flight_origin_dest_idx on flight_raw rebuild;

	Example 2
	 select count(1) from flight_raw where year = 2007;

	 create index flight_raw_year on table flight_raw (year) as 'bitmap' with deferred rebuild;
	 alter index flight_raw_year on flight_raw rebuild;

	 drop index flight_raw_year on flight_raw;

NOTE
Also note that indexes are not longer recommended or supported for the tez execution engine.
