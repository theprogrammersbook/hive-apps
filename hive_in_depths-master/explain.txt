EXPLAIN

	- Explain returns the execution plan for a query without running it.
	- Very useful utility for comparing two queries that will yield the same result in a bid to find out which implementation is optimal.

	Stages


	Extended


	Authourization
		explain authorization select year, month, avg(depdelay) from flight_ptd_clustd_raw where year = 2004 group by year, month order by month;

explain select year, count(1) from flight_raw group by year;

Example:
	Compare using explain the impact of partition using the two queries.
		--without partition
		explain select year, avg(depdelay) from flight_raw where year = 2004 group by year;
		--with partition
		explain select year, avg(depdelay) from flight_ptd_raw where year = 2004 group by year;	




ANALYZE
	- compute statistics that would enable more optimization from the CBO during query

		analyze table flight_raw compute statistics;
