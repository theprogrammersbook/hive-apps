Sampling
==============================
	
There are three ways to get data samples from a hive table
1) Random sampling
	Use order by RAND() and a limit clause to get the limit sample of data

	select * from rating order by RAND() limit 20;
	select * from rating distribute by RAND() limit 20;
	select * from rating distribute by RAND() sort by RAND() limit 20;

	NOTE: try each to see their performance on different datasets

2) This is a sample done on a clustered table using the bucket column. See clustering.txt for notes on clustering.
   Note that you will gain efficient sample is the 

   select * from rating_pq tablesample (bucket 2 out of 40 on movieId);
   select * from rating_pq tablesample (bucket 2 out of 40 on RAND());

3) Block sampling
	Give hive the liberty to sample data from a level of block. You can decide the size of the sample in either number of rows, of percentage of the dataset or byte size.

	select * from rating tablesample(30 rows);
	select * from rating tablesample(1 percent);
	select * from rating tablesample(1M);


select * from flight_ptd_clustd_raw tablesample (bucker 2 out of 12 rand()) limit 20;
